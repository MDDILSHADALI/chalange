        <p class="energy"><b>Green energy comes from natural sources <spam class="word">such as sunlight, wind, rain, tides, plants,<br>
           algae and geothermal heat.</spam> Theres energy resources are renewable energy surces<br>
           also have a much smaller impact on the environment then fossil fuels,<br>
           which produce pollutantss such as greenhouse gases as a by-product, contributing ti climate change.<br>
           Green energy, however, utilizes energy sources that are readily available all over the world,<br>
           including in rural and remote areas that don't otherwise have access to electrcity.<br>
           Green energy can replace fossil fuels in all major areas of use includin electricity,<br>
           water and space heating and fuel for motor wehicles.</b>
